        <p align="center">In June of 2017, Afghan President Ashrah Ghani signed the Cyber Crime Code into law, outlining the proper use of the internet and other communication devices. The code defines what qualifies as a cybercrime – something that had never previously been explained in legislation. With nearly 24 million internet users across Afghanistan, the threat of cyber warfare, gambling, terrorism, and even espionage pushed the state to instill the new code for the protection of citizens and government processes alike.
        Kabul, Afghanistan, 24 December 2020 – Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 has been an unprecedented and challenging year for many children and young people across Afghanistan.  Many have lost vital school days; some have lost loved ones; many have seen family income plummet; and too many were displaced.  Yet, for Afghanistan’s Girl’s Robotics Team, 2020 was a year of opportunities, adventures, and great success.Somaya Faruqi, 17, led the Girl’s Robotic Team, consisting of five girls from Herat, western Afghanistan, to develop a prototype ventilator. The creative idea was born of despair and a desire to support her country’s health system at a time when a limited number of ventilators across the country threatened the most vulnerable.</p>

        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>The two most popular sports of Afghanistan are cricket and football. This is not so much a surprise since they have a lot of open areas that are conducive to such sports. But the traditional sport of the Afghan people is what is called Buzkashi. If you have watched Rambo, you would have seen him playing buzkashi with the Afghan fighters. It is played by horse-mounted men who attempt get a goat carcass to a goal. Some games recorded can take up to days to finish. There are other sports played in Afghanistan like boxing, basketball and taekwondo, but football is where they seem to excel. In 2011 SAFF Championship, the Afghanistan national football team (formed in 1922) tasted its first victory against Nepal and in the 2013 SAFF Championship where they were the clear favorites, they won their first title against India. The heroes of that game were Azadzai and Sandjar Ahmadi who scored one goal each and goalkeeper Mansur Faqiryar, the reason why India never made one.</p>
